# Building firmware on your website: elekloader's kit

The kit lets any website build custom firmware in its visitors' browsers with elekloader's engine. The engine is the TypeScript port in `js/`, which writes the same bytes as the Python. The kit belongs to no website: elekloader's own page and a forum use the same files.

What the kit provides:
- **the engine,** in a worker started from your site;
- **a client** your pages call with promises;
- **a catalog format:** the cores and mods your site offers, each pinned by sha256;
- **elekloader's curated catalog** in that format, with every release;
- **tools** to copy a catalog's files, check them, and pin everything in a lock file;
- **the build page's helpers:** prepare a selection, follow a build in three steps, keep its log as text for bug reports.

What stays yours: your pages, their design, your accounts and your community. The kit has no UI and talks to no server.

## The pieces

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `kit/worker.ts` (`dist/kit/worker.js`) | the builder worker: one bridge (web/bridge.py's calls), the catalog and its cores loaded from your site, every file checked against its pin. It keeps to your site's origin. |
| `kit/client.ts` | `createBuilder({ base, worker })`: the worker, called with promises. |
| `kit/catalog.ts` | the catalog format, `parseCatalog`, `planBuild` (a selection's files, with what each mod requires, and the core it needs), `sourceUrl`. |
| `kit/build.ts` | `prepare` (load and check a selection), `buildStep` (the three steps from the log), `buildLogText`, `describeBuilder`. |
| `kit/protocol.ts` | the messages and replies, and `PROTOCOL`. |
| `tools/kit.ts` | `feed`, `sync`, `verify`, `lock`. |
| `examples/minimal/` | the smallest site: stock file, mods, build, log, downloads. |

## Put it on your site

### 1. Take the kit and a catalog

- **The kit:** `elekloader-kit-<version>.zip` from an [elekloader release](https://github.com/irpina/elekloader/releases). Check it against the sha256 in the release notes. `kit.json` inside names the commit it was built from, the protocol, and every file's sha256.
- **The catalog:** `elekloader-catalog.json` from the same release. Copy its files to your site:
  ```bash
  node tools/kit.ts sync elekloader-catalog.json <catalog dir> --device digitakt-mk1 --device digitone-mk1
  ```
  `sync` downloads each file from its author's release or commit, checks its sha256, and writes the catalog beside the files. It keeps only the devices you name. Keep the catalog in its own folder, apart from the kit's files, so each is pinned on its own.

### 2. Load it in your pages

**Without a bundler** (plain files), serve:
- the zip's `dist/` as it is, at `/elekloader/`, say: `dist/kit/worker.js` is the worker, `dist/kit/index.js` the page's side;
- the catalog folder at `/elekloader-catalog/`.

**With a bundler** (Vite, esbuild, webpack), vendor the TypeScript and let the bundler build the worker with the engine. For example:

```
vendor/elekloader/kit/          the zip's src/, tools/kit.ts, LICENSE, NOTICE, README.md and kit.json, unchanged
public/elekloader-catalog/      catalog.json and its files (a bundler's public folder is served and copied as it is)
elekloader.lock.json            the lock (step 3)
```

- **Start the worker** with the URL written out in full, so the bundler finds and bundles it:
  ```js
  new Worker(new URL('../vendor/elekloader/kit/src/kit/worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })
  ```
- **Import the page's side** from `vendor/elekloader/kit/src/kit/index.ts`.
- **TypeScript settings.** The kit's sources import each other with `.ts` extensions: they need `allowImportingTsExtensions` (with `noEmit`, or a bundler) and `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. They type-check under `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- **Lint:** leave `vendor/` out of your linter; it is upstream code.
- **The catalog in the bundle (optional):** a page can import `catalog.json` and pass it to `parseCatalog`, to list the mods without a fetch.

### 3. Pin it

```bash
node tools/kit.ts lock --kit <kit dir> --catalog <catalog dir> > elekloader.lock.json
```

Commit the lock file. In your CI, check that what you deploy is what you pinned:

```bash
node tools/kit.ts verify <catalog dir> --lock elekloader.lock.json --kit <kit dir>
```

The check fails on a changed, missing or extra file, in the kit or in the catalog. A bundler build can run the same check before it emits the catalog.

### 4. Call it from your page

```js
import { createBuilder, parseCatalog, prepare, buildStep, buildLogText, describeBuilder, PROTOCOL } from '/elekloader/kit/index.js'

const builder = createBuilder({
  base: '/elekloader-catalog/',                       // where catalog.json and its files are served
  worker: () => new Worker('/elekloader/kit/worker.js', { type: 'module' }),
})
const catalog = parseCatalog(await (await fetch('/elekloader-catalog/catalog.json')).json())
const ready = await builder.load()                      // the catalog and its cores, checked
if (ready.protocol !== PROTOCOL) throw new Error('another kit protocol')

// the owner's stock file (a File from an <input type="file">) and the mod ids they chose
const prepared = await prepare(builder, { catalog, device: 'digitakt-mk1', os: '1.53', stock: file, ids: ['digimono'] })
if (!prepared.ok) throw new Error(prepared.error)       // elekloader's words: conflicts, a wrong OS file, …

let step = 'composing'                                  // then 'packing', 'verifying'
const built = await builder.build(prepared.enabled, '2.0a', 'custom.syx', line => { step = buildStep(line, step) })
// built.files: each output's name, sha256 and bytes (an ArrayBuffer) to offer as a download
const log = buildLogText({ title: 'Your site build log', builder: describeBuilder(ready), device: 'Digitakt mk1', os: '1.53', version: '2.0a', enabled: prepared.enabled, result: built })
```

- **`prepare`** does the whole selection:
  - checks that the stock file is the device and OS chosen;
  - adds each mod from the catalog, with the mods it requires;
  - ticks the core the plan needs;
  - runs the live check.
- **`examples/minimal/`** does all of this, with downloads and the log, in about a hundred lines.

### 5. Serve it right

- **A secure context:** https, or localhost.
- **The page's CSP** needs `worker-src 'self'` and `script-src 'self'`. No `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`: nothing runs WebAssembly.
- **The worker** keeps to your origin by itself. It needs no CSP header and no special MIME types.

## Your ids and the catalog's

- **Devices** are the engine's keys: `digitakt-mk1`, `digitakt-mk2`, `digitone-mk1`, `octatrack`. `ready.info.devices` lists them, with their OS versions and their recovery text. If your site names machines its own way, map them to these.
- **Mods** are the `.elemod`'s own `id`: `catalog.mods[].id`. One id has a file per OS version; `releases(catalog, device, id)` lists those versions.
- **The OS version** is the stock file's, as the builder recognises it: `stock.os` from `setStock`, or the `os` your site already verified.

## Saved selections

Store the catalog's `revision` with any selection a user saves or exports. When your catalog changes, the revision changes, and an old selection can be shown for review rather than built silently with other files. An update to the kit alone keeps the revision, so it keeps saved selections valid.

## Your own list of mods

To offer mods that elekloader's catalog doesn't list, or to turn a list your site already keeps into a catalog, write the list and let `feed` read the files:

```json
{ "items": [
  { "repo": "you/your-mod", "tag": "v1.0", "file": "your-mod-1.0.elemod", "sha256": "…", "device": "digitakt-mk1", "summary": "…" },
  { "repo": "you/mods", "commit": "<the whole commit id>", "path": "elemods/other-1.0.elemod", "sha256": "…", "device": "digitakt-mk1" },
  { "repo": "irpina/elekloader", "tag": "v0.4.0", "file": "core-2.1.elemod", "sha256": "…", "device": "digitakt-mk1", "kind": "core" }
] }
```

```bash
node tools/kit.ts feed --list list.json --files <folder with those files> --revision <your revision> --out catalog.json
```

`feed` reads each file with the engine for its id, version, OS, licence and requirements. It refuses a file whose sha256 or device is not the list's. A file that names no licence takes the item's `license`, if you give one.

## Try it locally

From an elekloader checkout (or the zip, whose `dist/` is the first command's output):

```bash
node js/tools/build.ts js/examples/minimal/elekloader
node js/tools/kit.ts sync elekloader-catalog.json js/examples/minimal/catalog --device digitakt-mk1
python -m http.server --directory js/examples/minimal 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000, choose your own stock OS file, tick mods and build.

## Checklist

- [ ] The kit is vendored unchanged; the lock is committed; CI runs `verify --lock`.
- [ ] The worker starts from your own origin; the page's CSP allows `worker-src 'self'`.
- [ ] Stock files and builds never leave the browser.
- [ ] The device's recovery text is shown before a download.
- [ ] `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` ship with the site, with a link to the kit's source; each mod's licence is shown.
- [ ] The page checks `PROTOCOL` in `init`'s reply.
- [ ] Saved selections keep the catalog's `revision`.

## What a site must do

- **Keep the owner's files in their browser.** Never upload a stock OS file or a build. The kit never sends them anywhere: the worker refuses every request off your site. Don't add a path that does.
- **Show how to get back to stock** before offering a download. `built.recovery` is the device's own text. The owner flashes the file themselves; the kit never talks to a device.
- **Keep the notices.** Ship the kit's `LICENSE` (GPL-3.0-or-later) and `NOTICE`, and link to the kit's source: the release you took. The catalog gives each mod's licence; show it, and keep each mod's notices with it.
- **Leave the engine's files as they are.** The lock file and `verify` are there so you can show your users that the builder is elekloader's. If you change the engine, it is no longer the pinned one.

## The messages

A call is `{ id, call, args, data }`. The worker answers `{ id, log }` for each line while a build runs, then `{ id, ok: true, result }` or `{ id, ok: false, error }`. The client wraps all of this.

| call | args | result |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | `base`, `catalog` (default `catalog.json`) | the protocol, the engine's version, the catalog's revision and counts, the bridge's `info` |
| `add_catalog_mod` | `file` | the catalog's mod, fetched from your site and checked |
| `set_stock` | `name`, with the file's bytes | known by its hash (device, OS), or refused |
| `add_mod` | `name`, with the file's bytes | the owner's own `.elemod`, or why it is refused |
| `remove_mod`, `mods`, `tick`, `check`, `version`, `build`, `info` | as web/bridge.py | as web/bridge.py; `build`'s files carry their bytes |

Cores come only from the catalog, at `init`. A page cannot add a core of its own, but the owner can add a newer core as a mod (`add_mod`).

## The catalog

```json
{
  "schema": 1, "kind": "elekloader-catalog", "revision": "<the commit of elekloader's list, or your own>",
  "cores": [{ "file": "core-2.1.elemod", "sha256": "…", "id": "core", "version": "2.1", "device": "digitakt-mk1",
              "os": "1.53", "license": "GPL-2.0-or-later", "source": { "repo": "irpina/digislicer", "tag": "v2.1" } }],
  "mods": [{ "file": "digimono-0.13b.elemod", "sha256": "…", "id": "digimono", "version": "0.13b", "device": "digitakt-mk1",
             "os": "1.53", "license": "MIT", "title": "Digi Mono", "requires": ["core", "digichain"], "conflicts": [],
             "summary": "…", "on_unit": "…",
             "source": { "repo": "gdeo607/digi1_mods", "commit": "35bacb3…", "path": "elemods/digimono-0.13b.elemod" } }]
}
```

- **What each file says about itself:** `file`, `sha256`, `id`, `version`, `device`, `os`, `license`, `requires` and `conflicts`. `kit.ts feed` reads them from the file with the engine.
- **What a page shows:** `title`, `summary`, `description`, `category`, `author`, `needs_core` (the oldest core the mod links with) and `on_unit` (what has been checked on real hardware).
- **Where the file comes from:** `source` is a GitHub release (`repo`, `tag`) or a commit (`repo`, the whole `commit`, `path`).
- **File names are unique.** A site serves every file beside `catalog.json` under that name.

**Your own entries:**
- Add a mod your forum hosts, in the same shape, pinned to its release or commit.
- Run `sync` and `lock` again.
- Give it a `revision` of your own (your repository's commit, say), so you can tell your catalog from elekloader's.

## Versions

- **The kit's version is elekloader's** (`js/package.json`, `kit.json`).
- **`PROTOCOL`,** in `init`'s reply, changes when a call or a reply changes shape. A site written for protocol 1 should refuse another.
- **The catalog's `schema`** changes when the format does. `parseCatalog` refuses a schema it does not read.
- **A catalog's `revision`** names its list. Keep it apart from the engine's version: a site can update the kit without changing its catalog, and the other way round. Saved selections that name the revision stay valid across engine updates.

## For elekloader's releases

Each release attaches the kit and the catalog: run the **kit-build** workflow (Actions, by hand) with the release's tag. It takes `vX.Y.Z`, or `kit-vX.Y.Z` for a kit-only pre-release, which uses the latest release's cores. It attaches both files and their lines in `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and never replaces a file the release already carries with different bytes. With **test** ticked it keeps them as the run's artifact instead. Both are reproducible from the commit; the workflow runs:

```bash
python packaging/build_kit.py --out build/kit                   # elekloader-kit-<version>.zip, and its sha256
python packaging/build_web.py --catalog-list web/catalog.json   # the list's files: download each (as pages.yml does)
node js/tools/kit.ts feed --list web/catalog.json --files build/shop --core build/core/core-*.elemod \
     --core-source irpina/elekloader@<tag> --revision $(git rev-parse HEAD) --out build/elekloader-catalog.json
```

- **The curated list** is `web/catalog.json`, the one elekloader's shop used.
- **`feed`** reads every listed file with the engine and refuses one whose sha256 or device is not the list's.
